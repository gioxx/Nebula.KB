# Projects overview

This area hosts documentation for small, self-contained projects that live outside the Nebula PowerShell modules. Often, though, they’re still projects connected to the Microsoft 365 world.  
Each page focuses on how to run, deploy, and integrate a specific tool.

## Available projects
- [IntuneWinAppUtil GUI](M365/intune-win-app-util-gui) — WPF/PowerShell GUI wrapper to package Win32 apps for Intune.
- [Microsoft 365 Tenant Checker](M365/m365-tenant-checker) — Flask-based utility and minimal web UI to verify if a domain is registered with Microsoft 365.

🚧 More projects will be added here as soon as their documentation is ready (beyond what’s already in each GitHub repo’s README!).
